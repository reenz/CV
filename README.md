I was a auditor and now a full stack developer. At my previous work I had a strong desire to automate the manual audit processes but lacked the skills or platform to do so. Makers Academy provided me with the platform to go from a hobbyist programmer to being a full-stack developer.

I have inquiring mind which pushes me to learn things; recently learnt about building infrastructure as code using Terraform, deploying express app on AWS Elastic Beanstalk and running NodeJS app as a Docker container.
